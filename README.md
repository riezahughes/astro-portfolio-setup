# New Astro Portfolio

Test at a new portfolio site using just ASTRO and a few tools i've learned. This directory will be a template for anything i might want to work on in the future. If anyone wants to ask about anything, feel free. I'll be having fun switching from Gatsby to something that's much more dynamic in tooling.

A few key features this will have:

- The ability to deploy using a headerless CMS.
- Entire site's html and css will be under 1MB in size
- The entire frontend needs to be less black and white.
- The CV page really needs to make my skills stand out.
- Some page animations in places.

Whether i manage to get to this point or not is a different story. But it's all about the fun of playing with new toys for me. Wish me luck!

--------------astro default garbage i'll be keeping here for now.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
